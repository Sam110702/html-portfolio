<p>>Hello everyone, my name is Sardor. I graduated from Management Development Institute of Singapore in Tashkent with a degree in Business & Economics in 2022. Currently, I am working as a software developer at Nowhere, where I focus on developing web applications.</p>
<p>I have over 1 year of experience in software development, primarily using languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Python. My expertise includes working with frameworks like ASP.NET Core for backend development and React.js for frontend applications. Recently, I contributed to a project that involved building an e-commerce platform that improved user engagement by 30%.”</p>
<p> One of my proudest achievements was developing a mobile application using Flutter that helps users track their fitness goals. This project not only enhanced my skills in mobile development but also taught me valuable lessons about user experience design.</p>
<p>In the future, I aim to deepen my knowledge in machine learning and data science as I believe these fields will play a crucial role in shaping technology. I’m particularly interested in how AI can enhance user experiences across various platforms.</p>
<p>I’m excited about the possibility of joining Google Company because of its commitment to innovation and quality software solutions. I believe my background in full-stack development aligns well with your team’s goals.</p>
